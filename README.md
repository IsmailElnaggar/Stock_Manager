School project for my master's degree program. Course was taken at Åbo Akademi University. First time using React for app development.

Testing useing Google Chrome.

Functional Requirements of SPMS 
1. Create portfolio 10pt
a. The user can create an empty portfolio  
b. User should be able to enter the portfolio name 
c. A user should be able to create a decent number (min. 5-10) of portfolios

2. Add stock to portfolio 10p 
a. User must be able to add a stock to the portfolio by entering: i. the symbol of the stock ii. the number of shares he/she owns
b. There is no limit on the number of stocks a portfolio can contain 

3. View portfolio 10pt 
a. The user must be able to view the purchase value and the current value of the stocks in the portfolio. The current values current value and the purchase value of the stocks should be fetched from a stock market exchange API. For simplicity, a Refresh button can be used. 
b. The user must be able to change the currency between US dollar and Euro when displaying a portfolio (and its stocks). For simplicity, the USD/Euro exchange rate can be hardcoded (not fetched from an API). 
c. The user must be able to view the total value of the portfolio and its stocks updated with the latest values in the currently selected currency.
4. Compare stock value performances in a portfolio 10pt 
a. User must be able to see a graph showing the historic valuation of the stocks 
b. User must be able to adjust the time window of the graph by selecting the starting and ending date of the graph. 

5. Remove stock 5pt – A user can remove individual stocks from a portfolio 

6. Remove a portfolio 5pt 
a. The user can delete a portfolio 
b. When deleting a portfolio all associated stocks should be removed

7. The portfolios should be persistent over browser sessions 5pt 
a. You need to use the persistent local storage to save all data (portfolios, stocks, number of shares, initial values, latest values, and latest historical values) related to the created portfolios. That is, after closing and opening the browser the portfolio information should still be available regardless of having internet connection 

Non-functional requirements: 1. The layout should be responsive 5pt o You are free to decide on the layout and look of your application. The usability of your application will be considered when evaluating your solution. 

Constraints: - The project should be implemented using ReactJS. 







This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
